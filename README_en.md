# WindLin Studio
**Hello ðŸ‘‹, this is WindLin Studio, a vibrant non-profit organization.**

## Goals and Vision
We are committed to developing web services that are closer to work and study, starting from the details, so that you can feel the pure and fast web experience. The unsolicited service provided by us is completely free of charge.

## Ad Distribution
While a project is still being maintained and updated, we will ensure that the project is pure and concise.

## Organize your network
Since we are a non-profit organization, we minimize the cost of servers and storage in the provision of public services. As such, we use third-party services for our website access, file storage and file download, and we try to ensure that these services are accessible worldwide.

## Protocols, Policies, and Language
### Policy Conflicts
Our agreements and related policies are formulated in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China, and in the event of any conflict between these policies and the laws of the country or region where you are located, the laws and regulations of your location shall prevail.
### Translation conflicts
Our policies and agreements are written in **Chinese Simplified**. When you use a translated version or a version translated by a third-party tool, if there is a semantic conflict, please use the **Chinese Simplified** version.
### Language override conflicts
